Taken in Kyoto, walking through one of many zen gardens surrounding the temples. 
I knew the light was playing through this bamboo forest and I tried to capture the
 tall stalks by aiming from low to high, and I like the result!

Besides this Arcturus offers lots of layout configuration options and module
